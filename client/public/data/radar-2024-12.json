    "trendAnalysis": "Décembre 2024 marque une accélération de l'adoption des systèmes multi-agents et une maturation rapide des architectures RAG. Les organisations passent de l'expérimentation (POCs isolés) à l'industrialisation (déploiements à l'échelle) sur les technologies établies comme RAG et AI Agents. Parallèlement, l'émergence de l'Agentic AI crée une nouvelle vague d'innovation avec des cas d'usage jusqu'ici impossibles. La gouvernance IA devient un impératif stratégique, non plus seulement une considération éthique, sous la pression réglementaire croissante."
