# Cleanup Nested Directory

The `MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK` directory inside the main repository is a duplicate/nested clone and should be removed.

## To Remove Safely:

### Option 1: Using Git (Recommended)
```bash
# Remove from git tracking
git rm -r --cached MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK

# Remove the directory
rm -rf MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK

# Commit the change
git commit -m "chore: remove duplicate nested directory"
```

### Option 2: Manual Removal
```bash
# On Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK

# On Linux/Mac
rm -rf MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK
```

## Verification

After removal, verify:
- Main repository structure is intact
- No broken references to nested directory
- Git status shows clean state

## Note

This directory appears to be an accidental nested clone and contains duplicate files. It's safe to remove as all functionality exists in the main repository structure.
