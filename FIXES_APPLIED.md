# Fixes Applied - Template Cleanup

## Date: January 2025

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Hardcoded Production URLs Removed

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/app/core/config.py` - Removed all hardcoded Railway production URLs
- `backend/app/main.py` - Removed hardcoded CORS fallback URL
- `apps/web/next.config.js` - Removed hardcoded production API URL
- `apps/web/src/lib/api.ts` - Removed hardcoded production API URL
- `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/auth.py` - Replaced hardcoded URLs with environment variables
- `backend/app/api/email.py` - Replaced hardcoded URLs with environment variables
- `backend/.env.example` - Added CORS_ORIGINS documentation

**Changes:**
- All hardcoded production URLs now use environment variables:
  - `FRONTEND_URL` for frontend URLs
  - `BASE_URL` for backend URLs
  - `CORS_ORIGINS` for CORS configuration
- Fallback to `localhost` for development when env vars are not set
- Added clear documentation in `.env.example` files

**Environment Variables Required:**
```bash
# Backend
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000  # or your production frontend URL
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001  # optional, comma-separated
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000  # optional, defaults to request.base_url

# Frontend
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000  # your backend API URL
```

#### 2. ✅ TODO/FIXME Comments Reviewed

**Findings:**
- Most TODO comments found were in backup files (`.backup` extensions) - not active code
- Only 1 legitimate TODO found in active code:
  - `backend/app/tasks/notification_tasks.py:10` - Placeholder for notification implementation (acceptable)

**Action Taken:**
- No action needed - TODOs are either in backup files or are legitimate placeholders for future features
- The 536 count from grep was misleading - it included Storybook tags like `tags: ['autodocs']` which are not TODOs

#### 3. ⚠️ Nested Submodule Structure

**Issue:**
- Nested `MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK` directory exists inside the main repository
- Git status shows it as a submodule with 47 items
- This appears to be a duplicate or accidental nested clone

**Recommendation:**
1. **Check if submodule is needed:**
   ```bash
   git submodule status
   ```

2. **If not needed, remove it:**
   ```bash
   git rm --cached MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK
   rm -rf MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK
   git commit -m "chore: remove duplicate nested submodule"
   ```

3. **If needed, properly initialize:**
   ```bash
   git submodule update --init --recursive
   ```

**Note:** The nested directory contains duplicate files from the main repository. It's safe to remove if not actively used as a submodule.

## Summary

✅ **Fixed:** Hardcoded production URLs - All removed and replaced with environment variables  
✅ **Reviewed:** TODO/FIXME comments - Only legitimate placeholders remain  
⚠️ **Action Required:** Nested submodule - Needs manual review and cleanup

## Next Steps

1. Review and remove the nested `MODELE-NEXTJS-FULLSTACK` directory if not needed
2. Update deployment documentation to include required environment variables
3. Test the application with new environment variable configuration
4. Update CI/CD pipelines to set proper environment variables

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend starts correctly with `FRONTEND_URL` env var
- [ ] Frontend connects to backend using `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- [ ] CORS works correctly with `CORS_ORIGINS` configuration
- [ ] OAuth callbacks work with `FRONTEND_URL` and `BASE_URL`
- [ ] Email service uses correct URLs from environment
